# 🧠 Fine-Tuning LLaMA with PEFT for Question-Answering Tasks using UnSLoTh

This project focuses on fine-tuning the :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} model using :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) and the :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} library for Question-Answering tasks.

The goal is to adapt a large language model to specific QA data and improve performance with efficient tuning techniques.

## 🎯 What This Project Does

- Loads the LLaMA base model  
- Applies PEFT techniques for fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA, Adapters, etc.)  
- Uses UnSLoTh library for efficient training and evaluation  
- Fine-tunes the model on QA datasets  
- Evaluates the model’s performance in answering domain-specific questions

## 🔍 Key Libraries & Tools

- LLaMA (base large language model)  
- PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine Tuning)  
- UnSLoTh (efficient training framework)  
- Transformers / HuggingFace ecosystem  
- Google Colab environment
